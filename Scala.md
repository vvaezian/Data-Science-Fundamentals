```scala
print("Hello World")  // use double-quotes for strings
```
There are two types of variables: `var` (mutable), `val` (immutable):
```scala
val my_immutable_variable_name: Int = 10  // shorter version: val my_immutable_variable_name = 10
var my_mutable_variable_name: Int = 20  // shorted version: var my_mutable_variable_name = 20
```

Common Types for data-related tasks: `Double`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `String`
