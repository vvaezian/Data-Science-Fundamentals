```scala
print("Hello World")  // use double-quotes for strings
```
There are two types of variables: `var` (mutable), `val` (immutable):
```scala
val my_immutable_variable_name: Int = 10  // cannot assign another value to this variable
var my_mutable_variable_name: Int = 20
```

Common Types for data-related tasks: `Double`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `String`
