Mind Design II (1997)
- Chess is *digital* but billiard is not. (p 10)
- We measure the intelligence of a system by its ability to achieve stated ends in the face of variations, difficulties, and complexities posed by the task environment. (p 83)

#### Workflow
- If training error is high (compared to the acceptable error (e.g. human error)) then the model has high bias.  
We should try bigger model, train longer or try new model architecture.
- If dev (aka validation) error is high, then the model has high variance.  
We should try more data, regularization or try new model architecture.
